  <h2 class="w3-wide">patagucci x the migos</h2>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>a jack tercheria creation</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">We have created a totally new website for our biggest
    clients, the Migos. What makes this rap group so special? What's their
    plan now that they each own their own fashion line? Two months ago Quavo
    and I happened to run into eachother at a Five Guys in LAX. While we were enjoying our burgers he told me about this
    idea to turn his business into a website. Quavo knows that there is a lot of deception, and trickery
    in this website business so that's why he came to me first. I told him I'd make a super dope website for his own clothing
    line "patagucci" which won't be in stores for much longer. Another reason why I made this wesbite for Quavo is because I think
    he has the most successful rap group of all time. The Migos are a very unique group because they all didn't start out as musicians.
    The Migos grew up with no fathers, and no guidance in a very dangerous city. Whatever you hear them rap about they really lived that life;
    they carried the guns, sold the yay, and disregarded the females. The Migos have a heart of a hustler, anything that they couldn't have before
    now they have. You see it in the ridiculous jewelry they wear, and the foreign cars they drive. Once again, I was offered this job by Quavo
    personally and all the sections in the website were approved by Coach K, QC Manager. Enjoy.
